        	<p>There is one reason why I don't use Trello for personal
tasks, and it is the card URLs - they have the same name as
the card title.</p>
<p>For example, suppose I have a board with my personal tasks,
and in this board I have a card &quot;Call mom&quot;. The URL of this
card will be something like <code>trello.com/blah-blah/blah-blah-call-mom</code>.</p>
<p>What is wrong with this? Well, if you and only you(and always only you)
use the computer from which trello is usually launched, then it is not a
problem at all. But if someone else has access to your browser, or maybe
a friend has gave you his laptop for a while, and you have used it to launch Trello
in a browser, then you have a problem: even if you logged out, the browser's
history will contain all urls which you have visited.</p>
<p>— (<em>you</em>) Hey Johny, can I use your laptop for five minutes, just need
to have a look at my today's tasks.</p>
<p>— (<em>Johny</em>) Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>— (<em>you logging in, watch your tasks, click on some cards to see theirs
description, logging out</em>) Thank you, Johny.</p>
<p>— (<em>Johny opens the browser, wants to open some web-site, for example
<a href="http://theguardian.com">theguardian.com</a>. He presses &quot;t&quot;, and browser pop-up recent history urls.
Sadly, Trello also starts with &quot;T&quot;. Johny sees this</em>:</p>

<p>Johny did not ask you to inform him about this.</p>
