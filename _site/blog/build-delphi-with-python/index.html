        	<h2 id="the-problem-we-needed-to-solve" tabindex="-1">The problem we needed to solve</h2>
<p>In the company I work we develop and support some count of
desktop applications written in Delphi with a high usage of PL/SQL code
in the database. Besides building and copying an executable file to FTP server,
there are some additional steps we usually do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Building documentation (with Sphinx framework) and copying it to FTP server</li>
<li>Running database migrations</li>
<li>Compiling PL/SQL packages that we have changed since the last version</li>
</ul>
<p>Nowdays, a Python script does all these things, and I am going to tell which
steps we have done and what we plan to do to automate the build process
even more.</p>
<h2 id="the-old-way---using-of-a-batch-script" tabindex="-1">The old way - using of a batch script</h2>
<p>First thing that we were using is a batch script that was building an
application, right from CMD console or PowerShell. It looked like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-gkhjg">rem get the current branch name #http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6245570/get-current-branch-name
for /f &quot;delims=&quot; %%a in ('git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD') do @set original_branch=%%a

if %original_branch%==production (

call rsvars.bat
msbuild program.dproj /p:config=Release /t:Build
upx.exe program.exe

xcopy /R /Y program.exe A:FTP\LOCATION
xcopy /R /Y changelog.md A:FTP\LOCATION
goto end
)

if %original_branch%==testing (

call rsvars.bat
msbuild project.dproj /p:config=Release /t:Build
upx.exe program.exe


echo Copying executable to test directory...
xcopy /R /Y program.exe A:FTP\TEST\LOCATION

goto end
)

call rsvars.bat
msbuild projectfile.dproj /p:config=Release /t:Build

:end
</code></pre>
<p>Here, we are using <code>msbuild</code> to build our app, but for successfull build
we also need to setup required environment variables. Luckily, RAD Studio
comes with the <code>rsvars.bat</code> script, which setups them for us. This script is located at
<code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Embarcadero\Studio\RAD_VERSION\bin\</code> directory,
so you must add it to the <code>PATH</code> system variable. The last action usually isn't required -
the PATH has been updated during RAD Studio's installation.</p>
<h3 id="executable-file-compression" tabindex="-1">Executable file compression</h3>
<p>After build, the executable file's size is about 25 MB - not so much
nowdays, but anyway, we compress it with the help of the program called
<strong>upx</strong> . This step decreases size to approximately 11 MB - much better!</p>
<h2 id="why-python" tabindex="-1">Why Python</h2>
<p>Batch script is fine for builds, but we wanted to automate our database
migrations - we were running them as raw SQL files by hands - and we
started to search for a tool that can make this job for us.</p>
<p>At that time, we  had been already using <a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org">Sphinx</a> for
documentation, which is written in Python, and it was already installed
on our computers. Thus, to reduce
the count of used technologies, we picked Python as the main
language for automating our migrations.</p>
<p>First way that we wanted to try is to keep writing our migrations in raw SQL
and execute them in a some way with python. For this, we needed a driver for the
Oracle database. Thanks to python popularity, it wasn't a problem -
<a href="https://cx-oracle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">cx_Oracle</a> is easy to
install and it works well. But implementation of migrations
requires a lot of work, such as keeping the
history of changes and migrations' rollbacks. And we would these things should
be automated. At that time, the history of schema changes had been implemented
with the <code>migrations</code> table, where we were writing(by hands) the names
of the SQL scripts.
Rollback mechanism wasn't implemented at all - we were writing SQL for
&quot;upgrading&quot; schema, but not for changes'
rollbacks.
Because of all these factors, we started to look for a migration tool,
like <code>artisan migrate</code> for Laravel. The tool was found fast:
<a href="https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/">alembic</a>, and after a few
series of tests we approved it as our new migration tool.</p>
<h2 id="automating-migrations-with-alembic" tabindex="-1">Automating migrations with alembic</h2>
<p>Migrations are the changes to a database schema, like adding a column to a table, dropping
or creating new tables, creating indexes and so on.
Developers write migrations to be able to reproduce on a production database all changes
that they made during development. We were writing migrations as raw SQL scripts,
and then we were running them by hands in a IDE.
Sometimes we needed to revert a few last changes in
the database, and we had to write new migration scripts for
that and run them by hands again.</p>
<p>Alembic can, as any other migration tool, I believe, not only manage
schema's upgrades, but also revert them. First thing you need to do is to
install it on your system. It's better to follow the instructions from the
<a href="https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/front.html#installation">official
documentation</a>.
After that, the only thing you need to make it work is to configure
connection to your database. To do this, search for <code>sqlalchemy.url</code>
parameter in the <code>alembic.ini</code> file and modify it according to your
database settings. We use Oracle, and in our case it looks like
<code>oracle://user:password@tnsstring</code>. Now, we can create our migrations:</p>
<p>alembic revision -m &quot;Create orders table&quot;</p>
<p>This command creates a migration file, like
<code>1975ea83b712_create_orders_table.py</code>. It looks like this:</p>
<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;create orders table</p>
<p>Revision ID: 1975ea83b712
Revises:
Create Date: 2022-03-14 00:30:12.097402</p>
<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;</p>
<p># revision identifiers, used by Alembic.
revision = '1975ea83b712'
down_revision = None
branch_labels = None</p>
<p>from alembic import op
import sqlalchemy as sa</p>
<p>def upgrade():
pass</p>
<p>def downgrade():
pass</p>
<p>Here are two functions, <code>upgrade</code> and <code>downgrade</code>. The first one contains
the code for running the migration and the second one is for reverting
the migration. Alembic uses SQLAlchemy ORM to talk with a database, but
we didn't want to learn another one language - we like SQL, - so we have
changed the migrations’ template in a way that it run the queries that are
represented as multiline strings. This is the example of the migration written in a such way:</p>

<p>Let’s say we want to add a column <code>deleted_at</code> to the orders table for implementing  “soft delete” feature.
It  means that  records actually are not being deleted, but
instead <code>deleted_at</code> column is being filled with deletion’s date.
New migrations are created by <code>alembic revision</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>alembic revision -m &quot;Add deleted_at column to the orders table&quot;

<h3 id="limitations" tabindex="-1">Limitations</h3>
<ul>
<li>No need for <code>;</code> at the end of SQL command</li>
<li>If migration requires more than one SQL command, you have to
split them into separate calls - it seems like alembic can't execute
SQL with multiple separated statements. Thus, migration with
multiple statements appears to be like this:<pre><code>  &quot;&quot;&quot;Add deleted_at column to the orders table

<h2 id="recompiling-pl%2Fsql-packages" tabindex="-1">Recompiling PL/SQL packages</h2>
<p>We recompile needed packages in migrations. For this,
a helper function has been added to the migration template:</p>
<pre><code>def compile_package(con, dir, name):
    pck = open(f&quot;{dir}/{name}.pks&quot;, 'r', encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;)
    spec = pck.read()
    pck.close()
    pck = open(f&quot;{dir}/{name}.pkb&quot;, 'r', encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;)
    body = pck.read()
    pck.close()

    con.execute(spec)
    con.execute(body)
</code></pre>
<p>We keep our packages under the version control and work with them
by modifying corresponding files. Specification is stored in files with
&quot;*.pks&quot; extension, and body files have &quot;*.pkb&quot; extension.</p>
<p>Usually, implementation of a some feature don't affect much packages,
so we are fine with this function. If you usually compile a lot of
packages, it's better to add another one function that will accept
a list of the filenames. Package files shouldn't contain a final slash
in the source files, like this:</p>
<p><strong>Will NOT be compiled</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>create or replace package pck_test as

-- Some code

end pck_test;
/
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Will be compiled</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>create or replace package pck_test as

-- Some code

end pck_test;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Final semicolon, in the difference with SQL commands, is required.</p>
<p>We create separate migration for packages compilation, but without
any code in the <code>downgrade</code> function - &quot;uncompiling&quot; is not supported. Here is
the part of such migration:</p>
<pre><code>def upgrade():
    connection = op.get_bind()
    compile_package(connection, &quot;DB/packages&quot;, &quot;package_name_1&quot;)
    compile_package(connection, &quot;DB/packages&quot;, &quot;package_name_2&quot;)
    compile_package(connection, &quot;DB/packages&quot;, &quot;package_name_3&quot;)
    pass


def downgrade():
    pass
</code></pre>
<h2 id="replacing-batch-file-with-python-script" tabindex="-1">Replacing batch file with Python script</h2>
<p>Our first step was to implement the functionality of the batch script in python.
We needed to make a bunch of calls to external programs, like in the batch script,
and it is possible with <code>subprocess.run</code> function. In the batch script we had been
executing <code>rsvars.bat</code> before build. This script setups environment variables,
so we needed to make them visible for msbuild during its work.
Luckily, the third parameter in <code>subprocess.run</code> is environment object, which serves exactly for this purpose.
In our case, <code>rsvars.bat</code> looked like this:</p>
<pre><code>@SET BDS=C:\Programs\Embarcadero\Studio\20.0
@SET BDSINCLUDE=C:\Programs\Embarcadero\Studio\20.0\include
@SET BDSCOMMONDIR=C:\Users\Public\Documents\Embarcadero\Studio\20.0
@SET FrameworkDir=C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319
@SET FrameworkVersion=v4.5
@SET FrameworkSDKDir=
@SET PATH=%FrameworkDir%;%FrameworkSDKDir%;C:\Programs\Embarcadero\Studio\20.0\bin;C:\Programs\Embarcadero\Studio\20.0\bin64;C:\Programs\Embarcadero\Studio\20.0\cmake;C:\Users\Public\Documents\Embarcadero\InterBase\redist\InterBase2020\IDE_spoof;%PATH%
@SET LANGDIR=EN
@SET PLATFORM=
@SET PlatformSDK=
</code></pre>
<p>We placed all configuration parameters in the <code>config.ini</code> file, including these variables.
When the script starts, it loads environment variables into an object and
then passes it to <code>subprocess.run</code>. We didn't care much about clean and &quot;pythonic&quot;
code - our goal was to make things done as fast as we can,
and we finished up with these two scripts. All these files are located in the <code>build</code>
directory in the project's root folder:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>All environment variables are located in the build group.
The <code>project</code> section contains  paths to upx.exe, to the root of the project
and the name of the executable file. The <code>ftp</code> group contains settings for FTP:
connection and location for an executable file.
We use the following command to run build:</p>
<p>python build/build.py --compress --migrate --builddocs --upload</p>
<p>List of options:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>compress</code> - compress exe file with upx</li>
<li><code>migrate</code> - run migrations</li>
<li><code>builddocs</code> - build documentation</li>
<li><code>upload</code> - upload executable to FTP server</li>
<li><code>upload-test</code> - upload executable to FTP server, but in another</li>
</ul>
<p>None of these command line flags are required. By default, <code>build.py</code>
only builds an executable file.</p>

<p>Described solution can't be called a good one. It's quick and dirty, it requires
some grinding, but it works. Next step - relocate this process to Jenkins' instance.</p>
