> I don’t know… I think I would only like to tell them to try to be able to live more in solitude, to love to be alone with oneself more often.
> I think the problem with the young people today comes out of their effort to connect on the basis of “loud” actions, sometimes even aggressive ones.
> This desire to seek connection to not feel alone is a very unpleasant kind of symptom, in my opinion.
